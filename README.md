# TCP MULTI-CLIENT CHAT Application
This repository contains a TCP-based chat application written in C++. The application supports multiple clients connecting to a single server and communicating with each other in real-time. The server handles incoming client connections and broadcasts messages to all clients except the sender. The clients can send messages and receive messages from the server simultaneously using multithreading.
